# Advent of Code 2019
I'm taking part in Advent of Code 2019. A new puzzle is released every day leading up to Christmas like a traditional Advent Calendar. See https://adventofcode.com/ for details.

* I've decided to use javascript to solve these puzzles in order to practice my javascript which is a bit rusty since I've been mainly using C#/RoR/C++ in the last few years.
